"""QDT Constants Module

This module embodies the fundamental tension between mathematical purity and physical reality:

Mathematical Domain:
- Constants defined with arbitrary precision
- Perfect ratios and relationships
- Exact numerical values

Physical Reality:
- Approximate correspondence to observed phenomena
- Idealized representations of complex relationships
- Necessary simplifications of natural complexity

@dataclass
class QDTConstants:
    """Constants bridging mathematical idealization and physical approximation.
    
    Each constant represents:
    1. A mathematically perfect value in the abstract framework
    2. An approximation when applied to physical reality
    
    The tension between these two aspects is not a flaw but a fundamental
    feature of how mathematics interfaces with physical reality.
